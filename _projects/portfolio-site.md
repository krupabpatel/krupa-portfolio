# The Challenge

As a product manager, I've always been curious about the technical side of building products. I understand user needs, business strategy, and what makes a good experience, but I wanted to actually build something myself. The challenge was clear: create a professional portfolio website without spending months learning to code.

# The Vibecode Approach

I practiced what many people call "vibecoding" to turn ideas into a working website. This approach uses AI tools like Claude Code to handle the technical implementation while I focus on what I know best: defining the user experience, organizing information, and making strategic decisions about features and design.

Rather than learning CSS frameworks and JavaScript libraries, I could focus on product decisions: How should users navigate between sections? What information hierarchy makes sense? How should interactions feel on mobile versus desktop? Claude Code would then implement these specifications with proper responsive design, accessibility considerations, and performance optimizations.

# Building with Modern Tools

I chose a JAMstack architecture using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) has become the go to approach for modern websites because it delivers exceptional performance, security, and developer experience. Companies like Netflix, Nike, Spotify, and Airbnb use JAMstack for their marketing sites and web applications because it provides blazing fast load times and scales effortlessly.

The architecture generates static HTML pages at build time while connecting to APIs for dynamic functionality. This means the site loads instantly for users while still supporting content management through headless CMS integration. I get enterprise grade performance and security without managing servers or worrying about traffic spikes.

The vibecoding approach worked especially well for implementing JAMstack best practices. Claude Code handled the technical complexities of static site generation, API integration, and performance optimization while I focused on content strategy and user experience decisions.

# Making It Easy to Update

One of the coolest parts was setting up a content management system that lets me update the site without touching code. I integrated Sveltia CMS with a custom authentication setup using Cloudflare Workers to handle secure GitHub connections. Now I can easily add new projects, update my resume, or change content through a simple web interface.

This was definitely the most technically challenging piece, but the vibecode approach made it manageable. Instead of learning OAuth protocols and serverless architecture from scratch, I could focus on the user experience of content management while Claude Code handled the security and authentication complexity.

# Design and User Experience

The site features a cohesive design system with an earthy color palette (sand, sage, and lavender), smooth scroll animations, and mobile first responsive design. Every interaction was carefully considered, from the hover states on buttons to the way project cards animate into view as you scroll.

I spent a lot of time on the small details that make a site feel polished: smooth page transitions, contextual icons for different link types, and a photo carousel with elegant controls. These touches would typically require deep CSS and JavaScript knowledge, but vibecoding let me iterate on the experience until it felt just right.

# What I Learned

This project proved that product managers can absolutely build sophisticated technical products when we have the right tools. The vibecode approach allowed me to stay in my zone of genius (thinking about user needs, information architecture, and experience design) while still delivering complex technical functionality.

Most importantly, actually building something gave me a much deeper appreciation for the engineering challenges my teams face. I can now have more informed conversations about technical trade offs, performance considerations, and implementation complexity.

The result is a portfolio that's not just a showcase of my work, but a demonstration of how AI powered development is changing what's possible for non traditional developers. Sometimes the best way to understand your product is to build it yourself.
