## Commands to Remember
### Setup (run once)
- `brew install ruby` - Install Ruby via Homebrew (if needed)
- `/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/gem install bundler` - Install Bundler with Homebrew Ruby
- `BUNDLE_PATH=vendor/bundle /opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/bundle install` - Install Jekyll dependencies locally

### Development (if bundle install works)
- `/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/bundle exec jekyll serve` - Run local development server
- `/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` - Run with auto-refresh

### Alternative (if bundle install fails)
- `/opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/bin/jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml --force_polling` - Run with direct Jekyll for local development
- `/opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/bin/jekyll build` - Build for production (GitHub Pages builds automatically)
- `python3 -m http.server 4000` - Simple HTTP server for static files

### Ruby Setup Notes
- Project uses Ruby 3.4.5 (specified in .ruby-version)
- Uses Homebrew Ruby to avoid system Ruby permission issues
- Gems installed locally in vendor/bundle to avoid conflicts

### ARM64 Mac (M1/M2) Installation Issues & Fixes
**Problem**: EventMachine gem fails to compile with "iostream not found" error on ARM64 Macs

**Root Cause**: EventMachine's native extensions have C++ compilation issues on ARM64 architecture due to missing C++ standard library headers

**Solution**: Install eventmachine with specific C++ compiler flags:
```bash
/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/gem install eventmachine -v '1.2.7' -- --with-cppflags="-I$(brew --prefix)/include -I$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include/c++/v1" --with-ldflags="-L$(brew --prefix)/lib"
```

**Additional Required Gems** (installed individually):
- `gem install jekyll` - Main Jekyll gem
- `gem install minima` - Default Jekyll theme
- `gem install jekyll-feed` - RSS feed plugin (installed with minima)
- `gem install jekyll-sitemap` - Sitemap plugin

**Working Jekyll Command**:
- `/opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/bin/jekyll serve --force_polling`

**Note**: Bundle install still fails even after configuring build flags, so gems must be installed individually and Jekyll run directly

## Design System Implemented

### CSS Unit Guidelines (IMPORTANT)
- **Use rem units for most measurements** - Relative to root, more predictable
- **Use em units for media queries** - Better browser support
- **Keep 1-2px borders as px** - These are meant to be hairline borders
- **Base font size**: 1rem = 16px (browser default)
- **Conversion reference**: Divide px by 16 to get rem value
- **Media queries**: Use em units (e.g., 48em for 768px breakpoint)
- **All clamp() functions converted to rem** for consistency
- This ensures proper scaling and accessibility across all devices

### Color Palette (Earthy Tones)
- **Primary (Sand/Yellow-Tan)**: #E4D5B7 - Main brand color, warm and inviting
- **Secondary (Sage/Leaf Green)**: #8B956D - Natural, grounding color for key elements  
- **Accent (Lavender)**: #A594B8 - Used SPARINGLY for contrast and highlights only
- **Background**: Cream (#FBF9F4) - Warm, natural background
- **Text**: Charcoal (#2B2922) - Rich dark text color
- **Supporting Colors**: 
  - Warm Gray (#6B645C) - Subtle text
  - Sage Dark (#6B7752) - Darker green variant
  - Sand Dark (#D4C4A0) - Deeper sand tone

### Color Usage Rules (IMPORTANT)
- **Lavender is strictly for accents** - Never mixed in gradients with sand/sage
- **Sand and sage can be paired together** in gradients and combinations
- **Lavender usage limited to**:
  - Navigation hover underlines
  - Hero heading accent bar  
  - Project card top accent on hover
  - CTA button (Book Consultation)
  - Contact section secondary button hover state
- **Primary buttons**: Sand background â†’ Sage on hover (no lavender)
- **Secondary buttons**: Sage background â†’ Lavender on hover (accent contrast)

### Typography System
- **Headlines & Titles**: Rinjani Sans (local fonts)
  - Regular (400), Semibold (600), Bold (700) weights
  - Art Deco character, wide letterforms
  - Used for main headings and section titles
- **Body Text & UI**: Funnel Display (Google Fonts)
  - Modern, condensed, variable weight (300-800)
  - Excellent readability and contemporary feel
  - Perfect contrast with Rinjani Sans

### Font Integration

- Use the template content structure as a guide

This template system ensures that when Decap CMS is integrated, content creation will be streamlined, consistent, and aligned with the overall design system while providing maximum flexibility for showcasing diverse project types.

## Document Links System (MAJOR FEATURE)

### Overview
A sophisticated document management system has been implemented to replace the previous markdown content area. This system focuses exclusively on linking to important project documents like PRDs, research findings, and prototypes.

### Core Architecture

**Front Matter Structure**:
```yaml
links:
  - title: "Document Title"
    description: "Brief description of document contents"
    url: "/path/to/document.pdf"
    external: false  # or true for external links
```

**Design Principles**:
- **Document-only focus**: Specifically designed for PDFs, prototypes, and research documents
- **Professional presentation**: Clean, business-appropriate styling with sage green theming
- **Responsive scaling**: All elements scale proportionally across viewport sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper alt text, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation support

### Visual Design System

**Custom Document Icon**:
- **SVG-based**: Custom paper icon with proper document proportions (20:16 aspect ratio)
- **Three horizontal lines**: Represents text content within the document
- **Optimized thickness**: Lines scaled to match text weight at all viewport sizes
- **Sage green color**: Matches design system (#8B956D)
- **Responsive sizing**: `clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2rem)` ensures perfect scaling

**Layout & Styling**:
- **Left-aligned icon**: Document icon on left, content on right
- **Vertical centering**: Icon perfectly centered with text content
- **Hover effects**: Smooth lift animation, enhanced shadows, color transitions
- **Typography**: Funnel Display font with responsive clamp() sizing
- **Spacing**: All gaps and margins use vw-based responsive units

### Implementation Details

**Responsive Role/Tools Scaling** (Fixed Issue):
- **Problem**: Role and tools elements weren't scaling proportionally
- **Solution**: Implemented vw-based clamp() functions for all dimensions
- **Result**: Perfect scaling from mobile (18px) to desktop (22px) maintaining visual harmony

**Spacing Optimization** (Fixed Issue):
- **Problem**: Gap between role and tools was larger on mobile (24px) than desktop (8px)
- **Solution**: Removed conflicting media query overrides, implemented proportional spacing
- **Result**: Consistent 50% scaling ratio (8px desktop â†’ 4px mobile)

**Icon Design Evolution**:
1. **Started with**: Generic file icon with fold
2. **Improved to**: Document with text lines but square proportions
3. **Optimized to**: Proper paper proportions with refined line thickness
4. **Final result**: Perfect document icon with 20:16 aspect ratio and optimal visual weight

### Decap CMS Integration Ready

**Template Configuration**:
- `project-template.html` serves as baseline for Decap CMS
- Front matter structure supports unlimited document links
- Each project can have 0-many document links
- External vs internal link support built-in

**Content Management Workflow**:
1. Content creator uses Decap CMS interface
2. Adds document links via form fields (title, description, URL, external flag)
3. System automatically generates styled document cards with icons
4. Consistent presentation across all projects maintained

### Technical Specifications

**CSS Implementation**:
```css
.link-icon {
  width: clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2rem);
  height: clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2rem);
  fill: #8B956D;
}

.project-link:hover {
  transform: translateY(-0.125rem);
  box-shadow: 0 0.25rem 1rem rgba(139, 149, 109, 0.15);
}
```

**HTML Structure**:
```html
<a href="{{ link.url }}" class="project-link">
  <svg class="link-icon"><!-- Custom document SVG --></svg>
  <div class="link-content">
    <span class="link-title">{{ link.title }}</span>
    <span class="link-description">{{ link.description }}</span>
  </div>
</a>
```

### Core Architecture

**Navigation Intelligence**:
- **Same-page Detection**: Recognizes hash links (`#projects`, `/#contact`) and preserves natural scrolling
- **Page-to-page Detection**: Identifies navigation between different pages and applies slide animations
- **Referrer Analysis**: Uses `document.referrer` to determine navigation direction and source
- **Refresh Protection**: Prevents animations on page refreshes or direct navigation

**Slide Direction Logic**:
```javascript
// Homepage to project page = slide from right (content slides left)
// Project page to homepage = slide from left (content slides right)
```

### Technical Implementation

**HTML Structure**:
```html
<div class="page-container">
    <div class="page-content">
        {{ content }}
    </div>
</div>
```

**CSS Animation Classes**:
```css
/* Entry animations */
.page-slide-enter-from-right { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }
.page-slide-enter-from-left  { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; }
.page-slide-enter-active     { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; transition: 0.4s; }

/* Exit animations (for future enhancements) */
.page-slide-exit-to-left     { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; }
.page-slide-exit-to-right    { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }
```

**JavaScript Navigation Handler**:
- **Intelligent Link Detection**: Analyzes href attributes to categorize navigation type
- **Performance Optimization**: Only processes relevant navigation events
- **Development Logging**: Comprehensive console output for debugging navigation flow
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works with modern Navigation API and fallback methods

### Navigation Flow Examples

**Same-page Navigation** (No animation):
- `#projects` from homepage â†’ Natural scroll to Projects section
- `/#contact` from homepage â†’ Natural scroll to Contact section
- `Connect` button â†’ Natural scroll to Contact section

**Page-to-page Navigation** (With slide animation):
- Homepage â†’ Project 1 page â†’ Slide from right (content slides left)
- Project 1 page â†’ Homepage â†’ Slide from left (content slides right)
- Project page â†’ Back to Projects â†’ Slide from left (content slides right)

### User Experience Benefits

## Complete Page Transition System Overhaul (MAJOR REFACTOR - December 2024)

### Overview
After experiencing issues with the slide animation system (twitching, inconsistent behavior, browser back button problems), the entire page transition system was completely rebuilt with a simpler, more reliable approach using fade animations instead of slides.

### Changes Made

**1. Removed Complex Slide Animation System**
- Eliminated all horizontal slide transitions (translateX)
- Removed directional logic (left/right calculations)
- Cleaned up animation class management issues
- Fixed twitching and bouncing problems

**2. Implemented Cinematic Fade Transitions**
- **Simple opacity-based animations** (0 to 1 fade)
- **Consistent 0.3s duration** across all transitions
- **Universal application** to all internal navigation
- **Smooth ease-in-out timing** for professional feel

**3. Project Card Updates**
- Changed from `onclick` handlers to `data-href` attributes
- Ensures fade animations trigger properly
- Maintains clickable behavior and hover effects

**4. Browser Back/Forward Button Support**
- **Pageshow event handler** for back/forward navigation
- **Fade-in animation** when returning via back button
- **Prevents blank screen** during cache restoration
- **Consistent timing** with regular navigation

**5. Technical Implementation**
```javascript
// Fade-out on click
pageContent.style.opacity = '0';
setTimeout(() => window.location.href = href, 200);

// Fade-in on page load
pageContent.style.transition = 'none';
pageContent.style.opacity = '0';
pageContent.offsetHeight; // Force reflow
pageContent.style.transition = 'opacity 0.3s ease-in-out';
setTimeout(() => pageContent.style.opacity = '1', 10);
```

**6. Universal Navigation Support**
- Works with `<a>` links
- Works with `data-href` attributes
- Works with browser navigation
- Skips external links and anchor links

### Benefits of New System
- **Simpler**: No complex direction calculations
- **Reliable**: Consistent behavior across all browsers
- **Smoother**: No twitching or jumping
- **Universal**: Works with any navigation method
- **Maintainable**: Less code, easier to debug

### Final Animation Specifications
- **Duration**: 0.3s for all transitions
- **Fade-out delay**: 200ms before navigation
- **Fade-in delay**: 10ms for consistency
- **Cleanup**: 400ms to remove inline styles
- **Easing**: ease-in-out for natural motion
